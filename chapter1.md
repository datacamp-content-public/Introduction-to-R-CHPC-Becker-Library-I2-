This exercise will help you get familiar with using R as a calculator by using basic arithmetic operators, assigning names to objects, and calculating the area of a triangle.

Feel free to experiment with your own calculations as well.

R has a variety of arithmetic operators such as addition "+", multiplication "*",  division "/", exponentiation "^", and more.

Additional information on arithmetic operators in R is available using the help() function  by putting any of the arithmetic operators in quotes.

Check out the help documentation using the sample code below.

`@instructions`
#### 1. Basic Arithmetic operations

Add 8 and 4 and print out the result.

Multiply 7 by 9 and print out the result.

Raise 6 to the power of 4 and print out the result.

Divide 12 by 6 and print out the result.

#### 2. Calculate the area of a triangle

The area of a triangle = base * height / 2.

Assign the value of 2.48 to the object base and print it out.

Assign the value of 3 to the object height and print it out.

Calculate the area of the triangle, assigning the value to an object named area, and print out area.
