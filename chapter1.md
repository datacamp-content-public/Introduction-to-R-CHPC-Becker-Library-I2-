This exercise will help you get familiar with using R as a calculator by using basic arithmetic operators, assigning names to objects, and calculating the area of a triangle.
Feel free to experiment with your own calculations as well.
R has a variety of arithmetic operators such as addition "+", multiplication "*",  division "/", exponentiation "^", and more.  
Additional information on arithmetic operators in R is available using the help() function  by putting any of the arithmetic operators in quotes.
Check out the help documentation using the sample code below.
